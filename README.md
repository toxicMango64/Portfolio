## Editing instructions

To recreate/edit the website you'd need:

- A web server
- A SCSS compiler

The easiest method for development would be to use VS Code with the following extensions:

- [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass)
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

Once installed, simply click the `Watch Sass` button and `Go Live` button and you should be running the website locally and everything you change in the files will update.
