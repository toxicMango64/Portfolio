## Editing instructions

You need two things to edit this website:

-   A web server
-   A SCSS compiler

The easiest method for development is to use VS Code with the following extensions:

-   [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass)
-   [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

Once installed, simply click the `Watch Sass` button and `Go Live` button and you should be running the website locally and everything you change in the SCSS file will update.
